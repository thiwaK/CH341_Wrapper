# CH341 Wrapper
*A Python module for interacting with flash chips using the CH341 programmer.*

**The CH341 Wrapper provides a powerful and flexible interface for interacting with flash chips using the CH341 programmer. It allows users to perform targeted read and write operations on specific pages without needing to handle the entire chip contents, making it efficient for selective data manipulation. **
